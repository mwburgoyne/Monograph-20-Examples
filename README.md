# Monograph-20-Examples
Worked examples from Monograph 20 'Phase Behavior' - Appendices B and C

These examples are all done inside Jupyter Notebooks, and will require some packages to be installed to run properly. If you receive a 'module not found' error message or some such, then this is generally the problem. For those new to Python, while there are a few ways to install packages the one I generally use is the pip installer.

Start a terminal window (or a DOS window for those on windows) and simply type 'pip install packagename'

Where packagename is the repository you want to install

From memory, you should at least have the following installed;
numpy
scipy
tabulate
matplotlib

Happy to receive suggestions for improvement
